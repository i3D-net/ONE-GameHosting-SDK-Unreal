## <a name="how-to-test"></a> How to test ##

There are two ways to test a Game Server that is running an `One Arcus Server`:

1. The SDK contains a Fake Agent that can connect and simulate a real deployment. Build and run instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/i3D-net/ONE-GameHosting-SDK/tree/master/one/agent).
2. The Game Server can be uploaded to a live One Development Platform Deployment. See [here](https://www.i3d.net/docs/one/).

> Testing can be performed either in Unity Editor or on a build running in headless mode.

Optional - for developers that need to build and package the plugin locally.

### Windows ###

1. Add `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.25\Engine\Build\BatchFiles` in the `PATH` environment variable
2. Build the Arcus plugin:
    2.1 For the following steps: the `one-gamehosting-sdk-unreal` repository is cloned in the folder `%USERPROFILE%/source/repos/one-gamehosting-sdk-unreal`.
    2.2 Run the following command to build the sdk plugin:
    ```
    RunUAT.bat BuildPlugin -plugin="%USERPROFILE%/source/repos/one-gamehosting-sdk-unreal/ONEGameHostingPlugin/ONEGameHostingPlugin.uplugin" -package="%USERPROFILE%/.../Plugins/ONEGameHostingPlugin"
    ```
    Where `...` is the working directory where you want to copy the plugin.
    2.3. Copy the `ONEGameHostingPlugin` into Unreal Engine plugin directory: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.25\Engine\Plugins\One`, since it cannot be set directly via their toolchain.
